                    <h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>This repository presents an internship project that aims to create a comprehensive Power BI
                        dashboard for analyzing and predicting readings and power consumption from DX (Direct Expansion)
                        units and Fresh Air (FX) units in various malls across different cities in India. The project
                        utilizes synthetic data to simulate real-life scenarios and demonstrate the practical
                        applications of data analytics and predictive modeling in mall asset management.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The <code>data/</code> folder contains the datasets, which includes various readings
                                related to the mall ../assets such as On/Off Command, A/M Status, Run Status, Trip Status,
                                Schedule Mode, Time Schedule, Power Consumption in kWh, Filter Status, Indoor
                                Temperature, and Airflow Rates in CFM.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The <code>data_model_prep/</code> folder contains Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks
                                detail the data preparation process and the generation of synthetic data for analysis.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The <code>docs/</code> folder includes a research report, which documents the background
                                research conducted for the project and relevant findings.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The <code>models/</code> folder contains the serialized Python models that is used for
                                predictive analysis of power consumption in the malls.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The main centerpiece of the project is the
                                <code>Mall ../assets Analysis Dashboard.pbix</code> file, which is the Power BI dashboard
                                showcasing visualizations and insights derived from the data.</p>

                    <h2 id="understanding-dx-units-and-fx-units">Understanding DX Units and FX Units</h2>
                    <h3 id="dx-units-direct-expansion-units">DX Units (Direct Expansion Units)</h3>
                    <p>DX units, also known as Direct Expansion units, are a type of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air
                        Conditioning) system commonly used in commercial buildings, including malls. These units work by
                        directly expanding a refrigerant to cool the air, which is then circulated through the building
                        to maintain a comfortable indoor environment. DX units are often used to regulate temperature
                        and humidity, ensuring a pleasant shopping experience for customers within the mall.</p>
                    <h3 id="fx-units-fresh-air-units">FX Units (Fresh Air Units)</h3>
                    <p>FX units, or Fresh Air units, play a crucial role in maintaining indoor air quality within a
                        mall. These units are responsible for bringing in fresh air from the outside and circulating it
                        throughout the building. By continuously exchanging indoor air with fresh outside air, FX units
                        help to remove pollutants, odors, and excess humidity, creating a healthy and comfortable
                        atmosphere for shoppers.</p>
                    <h2 id="real-life-use-cases">Real-Life Use Cases</h2>
                    <p>This internship project was designed to reflect real-life use cases faced by mall facility
                        managers and maintenance teams. By utilizing synthetic data that mimics the behavior of DX and
                        FX units, the dashboard showcases how data analysis and predictive modeling can be applied to
                        optimize mall asset management and enhance energy efficiency. Some practical applications of
                        this project include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Predictive Maintenance:</strong> By analyzing historical data on DX and FX
                                units&#39; performance, the dashboard allows mall managers to identify potential
                                maintenance issues before they escalate. Predictive maintenance helps reduce downtime,
                                avoid costly repairs, and ensures a smooth shopping experience for visitors.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Energy Consumption Optimization:</strong> Understanding power consumption
                                patterns through data analysis enables mall operators to optimize energy usage. By
                                identifying peak usage hours and potential energy-saving opportunities, they can
                                implement strategies to reduce energy costs while still maintaining a comfortable
                                shopping environment.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Indoor Air Quality Monitoring:</strong> The dashboard provides insights into
                                indoor air quality based on FX units&#39; readings. Mall management can monitor
                                pollutant levels and make data-driven decisions to improve air quality, ensuring a
                                healthier environment for shoppers and employees.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Operational Efficiency Enhancement:</strong> By visualizing data related to
                                On/Off commands, AM Status, Run Status, and Trip Status, the dashboard helps mall
                                administrators monitor the operational efficiency of DX and FX units. Identifying
                                inefficiencies allows them to optimize scheduling and usage, leading to cost savings and
                                better overall performance.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Decision-Making Support:</strong> The dashboard serves as a powerful
                                decision-making tool for mall management. By presenting comprehensive visualizations and
                                interactive charts, it provides a clear understanding of asset performance, allowing for
                                data-driven decision-making in asset maintenance, scheduling, and energy management.</p>

                    <h2 id="project-details">Project Details</h2>
                    <p>This project was undertaken as part of an internship program to provide practical exposure to
                        data analysis and predictive modeling in the context of mall asset management. The use of
                        synthetic data allowed for controlled experimentation without impacting real-life operations.
                        The goal was to develop a sophisticated Power BI dashboard that showcased the capabilities of
                        data analytics and predictive modeling to address real challenges faced by mall facilities.</p>
                    <p>As an intern, the project involved conducting thorough research on DX and FX units, data
                        preparation strategies, and relevant data analysis techniques. The internship aimed to equip the
                        intern with valuable skills in data manipulation, modeling, and data visualization using tools
                        such as Python and Power BI.</p>
                    <p>The insights and outcomes derived from this internship project demonstrate the potential for
                        data-driven decision-making and energy efficiency optimization, providing a foundation for
                        further research and implementation in real-world scenarios.</p>
