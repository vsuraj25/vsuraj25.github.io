        <h1 id="sentiment-analysis-on-amazon-fine-food-reviews">Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews</h1>
        <p>This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset using two
            different approaches: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) with a Bag of Words
            approach
            and the Roberta Pretrained Model from Transformers.</p>
        <h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
        <p>The dataset used for this project is the <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews">Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset</a>. It
            contains reviews of fine foods from Amazon, including a variety of information such as the product ID,
            reviewer ID, helpfulness rating, review text, and more. The dataset provides a rich source of data for
            sentiment analysis tasks.</p>
        <h2 id="approaches">Approaches</h2>
        <h3 id="vader-valence-aware-dictionary-and-sentiment-reasoner---bag-of-words-approach">VADER (Valence Aware
            Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) - Bag of Words approach</h3>
        <p>VADER is a lexicon-based approach for sentiment analysis that is specifically tuned for social media
            texts.
            It uses a combination of lexical and grammatical heuristics to determine the sentiment of a given text.
            In
            this project, we employed the Bag of Words approach, which represents text data as a bag of individual
            words, disregarding grammar and word order. The VADER sentiment analyzer assigns sentiment scores to
            each
            review, indicating the positivity, neutrality, or negativity of the text.</p>
        <h3 id="roberta-pretrained-model-from-transformers">Roberta Pretrained Model from Transformers</h3>
        <p>RoBERTa is a robustly optimized method for pretraining natural language processing (NLP) models. It
            builds
            upon the popular BERT architecture and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks. In
            this
            project, we utilized the Roberta pretrained model from the Transformers library. The model was
            fine-tuned on
            the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset for sentiment analysis. By feeding review texts into the model, we
            obtained sentiment predictions for each review.</p>
        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The sentiment analysis results from both approaches were compared and evaluated based on accuracy,
            precision,
            recall, and F1-score. The performance of each approach was analyzed to understand their strengths and
            limitations in sentiment analysis tasks.</p>
        <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
        <p>To reproduce the sentiment analysis results, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset from <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews">Kaggle</a>.</li>
            <li>Preprocess the dataset by cleaning and preparing the review texts.</li>
            <li>Implement the VADER approach using a Bag of Words representation and calculate sentiment scores for
                each
                review.</li>
            <li>Fine-tune the Roberta Pretrained Model using the Transformers library on the dataset.</li>
            <li>Feed the review texts to the fine-tuned Roberta model and obtain sentiment predictions.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the performance of both approaches by comparing the sentiment analysis results.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
        <p>Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python 3.x</li>
            <li>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)</li>
